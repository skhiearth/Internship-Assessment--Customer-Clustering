# Customer-Clustering

This task has been completed as an Internship Assessment for Olcademy.

To handle the task of clustering customers, we are taking into account a fictitious database. Customers of the business are measured in the following criteria:

1. Demographics (Gender, Age, Annual Income)
2. Channels (Acquisition Source)
3. Engagement (Spending Score)

The Spending Score is a score on a scale of 1-100 which the business uses to rank its customers. A higher spending score means the customer engages more with the products of the business, and drives more profit than a customer with a lower spending score.
